## What Was Built

A production Azure environment deployed entirely via Bicep modules and Azure CLI. Every resource was defined as code, version-controlled, and deployed without a single portal click. Resources follow a consistent naming convention and mandatory tagging standard, and all observability is wired into a central Log Analytics workspace.

This is the kind of baseline a cloud engineer would build before handing an environment to an operations team: repeatable, documented, and auditable from day one.

## Resources Deployed

| Resource | Name | Module |
|---|---|---|
| Storage Account | `stcproduks001` | `modules/storage/storage-account.bicep` |
| Log Analytics Workspace | `law-core-prod-uks-001` | `modules/monitoring/log-analytics.bicep` |
| Network Security Group | `nsg-core-prod-uks-001` | `modules/networking/nsg.bicep` |
| Alert Rule | `alert-privileged-role-assignment-prod` | `modules/monitoring/alert-rule.bicep` |

All resources deployed to `rg-core-prod-uks-001` in UK South.

## Design Decisions

**Modular Bicep over monolithic templates.** Each resource type lives in its own module with typed parameters and `@description` decorators. Environment-specific values are passed via `.bicepparam` files, keeping modules reusable across dev and prod without duplication.

**Centralised observability.** NSG diagnostic settings point to the Log Analytics workspace, meaning all network flow data is captured in one place. The alert rule queries this workspace for privileged role assignments (`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`) and fires on any successful write — a standard detection pattern for privilege escalation in regulated environments.

**Consistent governance by default.** Every module enforces three tags: `environment`, `managed-by: bicep`, and `project: azure-landing-zone-lite`. This is not a manual step — it is baked into each module so no resource can be deployed untagged regardless of who runs the deployment.

**Storage hardened at the module level.** Public access disabled, minimum TLS 1.2 enforced, and network ACLs set to deny by default. These constraints cannot be bypassed through the portal after deployment because they are defined in code and redeployed idempotently.

## Skills Demonstrated

| Area | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Infrastructure as Code | Bicep modules with typed parameters, `@description` decorators, and resource outputs |
| Cloud Governance | Mandatory tagging enforced at module level — not applied manually after deployment |
| Observability | NSG diagnostics piped to Log Analytics; alert rule querying for privileged role assignment events |
| Secure Configuration | Storage hardened by default: no public access, TLS 1.2 minimum, network deny ACL |
| CLI Deployment | All resources deployed via `az deployment group create` with no portal interaction |
| Naming Standards | Consistent `{type}-{workload}-{env}-{region}-{instance}` convention applied across all resources |
| Separation of Concerns | Module definitions kept separate from environment parameter files for reusability |

## Tools
